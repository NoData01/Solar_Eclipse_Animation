# Solar Eclipse Animation ðŸŒ‘âœ¨

This repository contains a solar eclipse animation created with HTML and CSS. The animation simulates the gradual shadowing and revealing of a "moon" element to mimic the effect of a solar eclipse, with a smooth, alternating animation loop.

## Features
- **Dynamic Animation**: CSS animations bring the eclipse effect to life, with transitions that adjust the moon's shadow, position, and glow.
- **Responsive Design**: The animation adapts for smaller screens with media queries, maintaining an optimal viewing experience across devices.
- **Custom Gradients**: Both the background and moon element utilize gradient styling to enhance depth and realism.

Feel free to fork, modify, or use this code as a reference for CSS animations and creative visual effects!
